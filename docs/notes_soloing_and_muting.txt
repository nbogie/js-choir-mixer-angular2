Solo'ing vs muting

Do the simplest thing that could work


When a solo button is toggled ON:
  * If there is already a solo group existing, the track joins it and is completely unmuted.
  * If there is no solo group existing: 
      * a solo group is made
      * the track is added to it
      * all other non-muted tracks are "muted-for-solo"

When a solo button is toggled OFF:
  * If it is the last track in the solo group, the solo group is disbanded, and all other tracks which were "muted-for-solo" are cleared of that status (they may remain "muted").
  * If it is not the last track in the group, the track is removed from the group and is "muted-for-solo".

What happens when a mute button is toggled ON when there is a solo in progress?
 - if the track is part of the solo group?     - ignored
 - if the track is not part of the solo group? - ignored
What happens when a mute button is toggled OFF when there is a solo in progress?
 - if the track is part of the solo group?     - ignored
 - if the track is not part of the solo group? - ignored

Solo'ing status must resume on stop, play, play from point, etc.


The volume of a track considers: 
  isMuted && isMutedForSolo


Impl notes:

"soloGroup" can be represented in the DOM by those tracks which have their solo button set to class solobutton-on.
